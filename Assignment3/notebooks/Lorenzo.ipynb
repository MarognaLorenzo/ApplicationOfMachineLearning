    "# Assignment 3 ‚Äì Topic Modeling and Clustering for Online Social Media Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Due: Friday January 12 at 14:00 CET*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third assignment of the course Applications of Machine Learning (INFOB3APML), you will learn to use topic modeling and clustering to identify topics in online social media data. The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "- understand and process the text data\n",
    "- use the clustering algorithm to determine clusters in real-life data\n",
    "- use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to identify discussed topics in real-life text data \n",
    "- use the visualization tools to validate the results of unsupervised learning and interpret your findings\n",
    "- reflect on the difference between two type of unsupervised learning algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to discover the different ‚Äòtopics‚Äô from a real social media text dataset. The project is divided into two parts (4 subtasks):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part contains data processing (1.1) and feature extraction (1.2) from the raw text data.\n",
    "- In the second part, you will implement two methods (2.1), a topic modeling method and a clustering method, to identify topics from the processed data. Then, the evaluation will be done by using visualization tools (2.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Provided files:\n",
    "- The dataset: data/raw_data.txt\n",
    "- A tutorial notebook showcases some packages you could use for this assignment (optional): Ass3_tutorial.ipynb\n",
    "- Some sample visualization codes for interpreting the topic results: viz_example.ipynb"
