    " -   Formalizing a practical problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    " -   Gaining familiarity with the OpenAI Gym framework (recently renamed as Gymnasium) and utilizing it to implement RL agents.\n",
    " -   Applying SARSA and Q-learning algorithms to solve the 'robot in a maze' MDP problem.\n",
    " -   Evaluating the outcomes of the reinforcement learning process and interpreting your findings.\n",
    " -   Reflecting on the distinctions between the two types of RL algorithms employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By accomplishing these objectives, you will not only enhance your understanding of RL algorithms but also develop practical skills in formulating and solving complex problems in the context of autonomous navigation within a maze.\n",

    "     2.2. implementing your own RL agents, and      \n",
