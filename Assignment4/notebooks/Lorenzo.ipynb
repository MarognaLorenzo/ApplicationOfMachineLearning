    " -   Formalizing a practical problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    " -   Gaining familiarity with the OpenAI Gym framework (recently renamed as Gymnasium) and utilizing it to implement RL agents.\n",
    " -   Applying SARSA and Q-learning algorithms to solve the 'robot in a maze' MDP problem.\n",
    " -   Evaluating the outcomes of the reinforcement learning process and interpreting your findings.\n",
    " -   Reflecting on the distinctions between the two types of RL algorithms employed.\n",

    "By accomplishing these objectives, you will not only enhance your understanding of RL algorithms but also develop practical skills in formulating and solving complex problems in the context of autonomous navigation within a maze.\n",

    "     2.2. implementing your own RL agents, and      \n",

Your task involves implementing an RL agent and training it to discover the shortest route to achieve the maze goal. In this MDP, the environment is represented as a grid world (a maze), with the agent being a robot. At each time step, the robot begins at a random location and can move within the grid world. The overarching objective is to find the way out, reaching the final location. Consequently, you will need to identify a fixed goal position within the maze."
